Research question:
How to determine which physiochemical properties make wine 'good'?

Splitting the data into test and training data
```{r}
set.seed(327) 

#70% for training, 30% for test
wine_split <- initial_split(wine, 
                               prop = .7)
wine_train <- training(wine_split)
wine_test <- testing(wine_split)
```

Taking the data out for a walk:
```{r}
wine_train%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = quality))+
  geom_bar()


wine_train%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = quality))+
  geom_bar(aes(x = quality))


```
